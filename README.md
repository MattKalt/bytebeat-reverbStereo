# Stereo Multitap Detune Reverb

An effect for Bytebeat.
Similar to the effect used on the competition entry "H4xxed Up For Barbecue" (which was inspired by the detune delay from [Dead Data by Feeshbread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bytebeat/comments/1fzb7eh/dead_data_my_entry_for_byte_battle_season_1/)), but with much improved functionality.
